# Weather Dashboard

UCF Module 06 Challenge - Weather Dashboard

---------------------
## Description

The goal of this challenge, was to build a web app that showed the current weather and a 5-day weather forecast, when a user input a city name.


This web app allows instant weather feedback when a user types in their desired location. It saves their search for quick access if desired, and logs them into storage to assure the best user experience.  

----------------------
## Getting Started

### User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Notes
As you are able to see in the screenshot that is provided in this readme, the whole content fits on a 14in, 1920x1080 pixels, screen. I don't know why GitHubs deployment of the site change is so now it needs to be scrolled. There will be an update to this site soon to help eliminate the scrolling need.
